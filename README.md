A tool for League of Legends players to track their hero damage dealt in games.

Based on an old project I did back in 2014 with Angular 1. The whole site was rewritten in React + vanilla Flux during the spring of 2016.

#### Usage: 

1. Type a summoner name into the text field box.
2. Choose a region out of the options.
3. Click the results and admire the damage dealt.

#### Example: 

1. FNC Rekkless 
2. EUW 
3. Click
